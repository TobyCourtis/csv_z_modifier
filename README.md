# csv_z_modifier
Python program used to modifier z placements in CSV files.


How To Run:

1) Execute: python change_z_placements.py
  - If needed the Python file can be modified to change the default read directory for CSV files. By default this is the same folder as the Python file.

2) Prompts will guide the user through running the Python file - file names should be given without ".csv" at the end and z placements should be given as integers
